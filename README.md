# CS3241-Lab3

## What is CS3241?
CS3241 Computer Graphics (CG) is a course part of the School of Computing (SoC) in NUS. 

CS3241 "teaches some graphics hardware devices, reviews matrix transforms and discusses the fundamental areas of CG"

"After completing the course, students are expected to understand basic computer graphics terminology and concepts" - NUSMods.

It teaches concepts such as 3D matrix transforms, different hidden surface removal algorithms (Depth sort, Z-buffer),
illumination and shading, different bump mapping techniques and ray tracing. It also goes through the old OpenGL specification,
thorougly examining each stage of its pipeline.

## Lab 3 Rendering Features
The lab features simulating a reflection using a 2nd alternative OpenGL camera. It also features texture mapping.
Objects such as the Minecraft Dirt Block and the Sword was designed by myself, and each Primitive's vector coordinates and transforms are calculated and drawn by hand as well.
