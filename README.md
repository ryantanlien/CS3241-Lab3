CS3241 "teaches some graphics hardware devices, reviews matrix transforms and discusses the fundamental areas of CG"

"After completing the course, students are expected to understand basic computer graphics terminology and concepts" - NUSMods.

It teaches concepts such as 3D matrix transforms, different hidden surface removal algorithms (Depth sort, Z-buffer),
